Note: During the deployment of the Angular application, I encountered the following error:

##[error]No hosted parallelism has been purchased or granted. To request a free parallelism grant, please fill out the following form: https://aka.ms/azpipelines-parallelism-request

I have submitted a request for parallel job access, but as it is not automatically granted to my organization, it may take more than a day for Azure to process my request.
